**Overview**
This folder contains evidence-based documentation for the library management system. Every claim is tied to source code, and any uncertainty is labeled **Hypothesis** with what is missing.

**How To Use**
1. Start at `documentation/INDEX.md` for the guided reading path.
2. Use the module docs in `documentation/03-backend/modules/` to locate feature code quickly.
3. Check `documentation/07-quality/` before making changes to understand known risks.

**Evidence Policy**
- All factual statements cite file paths and (when possible) method or class names.
- If evidence is incomplete, the statement is explicitly marked **Hypothesis**.
- No secrets are included. Values from `.env` are never copied.

**What Is Covered**
- System features, modules, and flows
- Backend and frontend structure
- Local setup and deployment notes
- Data models and routes
- Risks and pitfalls found in code
